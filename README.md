# Kaggle Survey Insights (2017â€“2021)

This project focuses on **data cleaning, categorical handling, and insight generation** using the Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.  
It demonstrates practical data wrangling, visualization, and reporting skills with real-world messy survey data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017â€“2021 merged)
- **Objective:**  
  - Clean raw survey data (handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting)  
  - Encode categorical variables and process multi-select responses  
  - Generate meaningful insights on respondent demographics, preferences, and tools  
  - Produce a **summary dashboard** highlighting top 5 insights  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Conda (`survey-env`)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib & Seaborn dashboards  
- **Exported Deliverables:** cleaned dataset (`.csv`), summary dashboard (`.pdf`), conda environment (`.yml`)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and metadata rows  
   - Fixed encoding and formatting issues  
   - Standardized categorical fields (Age, Education, Coding Experience, Occupation)  

2. **Categorical Handling**
   - Label-mapped age groups, education levels, coding experience  
   - Processed multi-select questions (programming languages, ML frameworks, cloud platforms)  

3. **Insight Generation**
   - Demographics: Age, Education, Coding Experience  
   - Top Programming Languages (Pie Chart)  
   - Top ML Frameworks  
   - Cloud usage patterns  

4. **Dashboard**
   - A single 3Ã—2 dashboard summarizing the **Top 5 Insights**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Top 5 Insights (Example)
1. Most respondents are aged **25â€“29**, followed by **22â€“24**.  
2. Majority hold a **Masterâ€™s degree** as their highest qualification.  
3. A large share report **3â€“5 years of coding experience**.  
4. **Python** dominates as the top programming language, followed by R and SQL.  
5. **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** are the most widely used ML frameworks.
